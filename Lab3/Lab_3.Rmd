library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/USER/Desktop/DataProcessingLabs/Lab3")
data <- readRDS("hike_data.rds")

get_type <- function (x) strsplit(x, split = ", ")[[1]][2]

  miles <- as.numeric(miles)

    miles <- miles * 2

cht <- data.frame(
  gain = as.numeric(data$gain),
  highpoint = as.numeric(data$highpoint),
  rating = as.numeric(data$rating),
  trip = sapply(data$length, function(x) strsplit(x, split = ", ")[[1]][2]),

  location_general = sapply(data$location, get_location),
  id = seq.int(nrow(data))
)
```

```{r}
head(cht)
```

Question 1. How many routes have rating more than 4.9
```{r}
new_data <- subset(cht, rating > 4.9)
nrow(new_data)
```

Question 2. How many routes are “Good for kids” (hint: you can use (unnest function)?
```{r}
new_data <- subset(unnest(data, cols = c("features")), features == "Good for kids")
nrow(new_data)
```

Question 3. Which unique features can routes have?
```{r}
features <- unique(unnest(data, cols = c("features"))$features)
features
```

Question 4. What is the most common rating of a route?
```{r}
tail(names(sort(table(cht$rating))), 1)
```

Question 5. Your own question and answer.
How many routes have highpoint more than 10000?
```{r}
new_data <- subset(cht, highpoint > 10000)
nrow(new_data)
```
